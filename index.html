                        The tallest rose bush ever recorded stood at an incredible 23 feet tall.
            After a fossil of a rose was discovered in Colorado, archaeologists determined roses have existed for more than 35 million years.
            Roses aren’t as delicate as they look. Don’t believe us? Just ask residents of Hildesheim, Germany. Hildesheim is home to a large rose bush that has been growing on the wall of the Cathedral of Hildesheim for over 1,000 years.
            People in 15th century England lived through the “War of Roses.” The war got its name after roses were used to symbolize which side people supported or were fighting for. White roses symbolized Yorkshire and red roses symbolized Lancaster.
            Thank goodness bulky CDs are a thing of the past — there are over 4,000 songs about roses out there.
            Roses are one of only three flowers mentioned in the bible. The other two are lilies and camphire.
            For years, breeders tried to genetically manipulate different species and colors of roses to create a blue one. In 2004, the world got its first blue rose.
            After he spent 15 years growing it, creator David Austin sold his Juliet Rose at the 2006 Chelsea Show for nearly $15.8 million.
            Roses are out of this world — literally! The very first rose to travel to space was named Overnight Scentsation. The play on its name had to do with the fact that researchers were bringing the miniature rose to space to learn how low gravity impacted a rose’s scent.
            Many species of roses have been known to grow fruit. The fruit of a rose is called a rose hip and closely resembles a berry.
            On November 20, 1986, President Ronald Reagan officially made the rose the national flower emblem of the United States. He even did this while standing in the famous White House Rose Garden.

                    In terms of development, the first year of a cat’s life is equal to the first 15 years of a human life. After its second year, a cat is 25 in human years. And after that, each year of a cat’s life is equal to about 7 human years.
        Cats can rotate their ears 180 degrees.
        The hearing of the average cat is at least five times keener than that of a human adult.
        In the largest cat breed, the average male weighs approximately 20 pounds.
        Domestic cats spend about 70 percent of the day sleeping. And 15 percent of the day grooming.
        A cat cannot see directly under its nose.
        Most cats have no eyelashes.
        Cats have five toes on each front paw, but only four on the back ones. It’s not uncommon, though, for cats to have extra toes. The cat with the most toes known had 32—eight on each paw!
        Some believe that if you dream about a white cat, good luck will follow.
        Meows are not innate cat language—they developed them to communicate with humans!

                        Birds are vertebrate which, are warm-blooded creatures and have more correlated with reptiles than mammals. They have a four-chambered heart. Plus, they have forelimbs which have modified into wings, a hard-shelled egg, and keen visualization, one of the major senses which they rely on most for getting information about the atmosphere. In this article, we shall discuss more interesting facts about birds.
            Many birds can run, jump, swim, and dive also they don’t just rely upon flying. But there are some birds like penguins that have lost the ability to fly but retained their wings. Birds almost find everywhere in the world in almost all territories. There are around every type and size of birds the largest is the ostrich which, is around nine feet and, also the smallest one which, is only two-inch-long, humming bee. The structure is very important it reflects upon its ability to fly. The wings, for instance, had formed to create lift. The prime edge is thicker than the back edge, which has covered in feathers that narrow to a point. Interestingly, you know an airplane’s wings modeled after bird wings.
            Birds’ bones and muscular system of wings are also highly specialized. The main bone, the humerus, is resembled the upper arm of a mammal. It attaches to the bird’s air sac structure, which has connected with its lungs. The powerful shoulder muscles, attached to the keel, a special ridge of bone that runs down the center of the wide sternum, or breastbone.
            Furthermore, birds use their tail feathers for steering. They have an exclusive digestive system that lets them eat when they want. Interesting facts that birds usually eat during flight and digest later. During flying they use their beaks for grabbing and swallowing food. Even the way a bird reproduces is best for the flight. God has made a unique system instead of carrying the extra weight of emerging young ones inside their bodies like other mammals, they lay eggs and incubate them in a nest.
            There are around more than 150 kinds of birds have become extinct since 1600. Even though many more may have died out that scientists don’t know about. European explorers didn’t just kill the species. Archeology shows that when they first arrived in ancient times in Hawaii and on islands of the South Pacific and Caribbean, many birds had killed before Europeans. Even they had never seen before. Around 9,500 species of birds exist in the world. Experts have grouped these species into 30 categories. One of the interesting facts that birds are the most prevalent of all creatures around the world.

                        Many owl species have asymmetrical ears. When located at different heights on the owl’s head, their ears are able to pinpoint the location of sounds in multiple dimensions. Ready, aim, strike.
            The eyes of an owl are not true “eyeballs.” Their tube-shaped eyes are completely immobile, providing binocular vision which fully focuses on their prey and boosts depth perception.
            Owls can rotate their necks 270 degrees. A blood-pooling system collects blood to power their brains and eyes when neck movement cuts off circulation.
            A group of owls is called a parliament. This originates from C.S. Lewis’ description of a meeting of owls in The Chronicles of Narnia.
            Owls hunt other owls. Great Horned Owls are the top predator of the smaller Barred Owl.
            The tiniest owl in the world is the Elf Owl, which is 5 - 6 inches tall and weighs about 1 ½ ounces. The largest North American owl, in appearance, is the Great Gray Owl, which is up to 32 inches tall.
            The Northern Hawk Owl can detect—primarily by sight—a vole to eat up to a half a mile away.
            In fat years when mice are plentiful, usually monogamous Boreal Owls are apt to be promiscuous. Because easy prey means less work for parents feeding their young, males have been caught mating with up to three females, while females have been seen with at least one beau on the side.
            Barn Owls swallow their prey whole—skin, bones, and all—and they eat up to 1,000 mice each year.
            Northern Saw-whet Owls can travel long distances over large bodies of water. One showed up 70 miles from shore near Montauk, New York.
            Not all owls hoot! Barn Owls make hissing sounds, the Eastern Screech-Owl whinnies like a horse, and Saw-whet Owls sound like, well, an old whetstone sharpening a saw. Hence the name. 
            Owls are zygodactyl, which means their feet have two forward-facing toes and two backward-facing toes. Unlike most other zygodactyl birds, however, owls can pivot one of their back toes forward to help them grip and walk.
